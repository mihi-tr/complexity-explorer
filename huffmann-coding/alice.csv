I--DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE,3.7081320646586016,3.9285715
Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the,3.821956149223952,4.9
"bank, and of having nothing to do. Once or twice she had peeped into the",3.9291611990699016,4.909091
"book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in",3.9259785075431037,4.7
"So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the",3.9445210165295994,4.8095236
"day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of",3.9103375235329767,4.8095236
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and,4.1717127551432585,4.869565
"picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran",4.027613426014843,4.8636365
close by her.,3.3927474104487847,3.6363637
"There was nothing so very remarkable in that, nor did Alice think it so",4.055253101617894,4.9565215
"very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ""Oh dear! Oh,4.031524459280053,5.0416665
dear! I shall be too late!"" But when the Rabbit actually took a watch",3.9624391700119177,5.130435
"out of its waistcoat-pocket and looked at it and then hurried on, Alice",3.977143691497203,4.7619047
"started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never",3.671638277443927,4.647059
"before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take",3.7528729574662965,4.6666665
"out of it, and, burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after",4.005450295510703,4.75
"it and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole, under",3.9664018136937584,4.7619047
"the hedge. In another moment, down went Alice after it!",3.9421139772324505,4.857143
[Illustration],3.521640636343319,3.75
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then,4.005626261064483,5.0
"dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think",3.9430998958449845,4.65
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed,3.9992717607518733,4.5789475
to be a very deep well.,3.4270714800190296,4.142857
"Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had",3.7628247763622684,4.611111
"plenty of time, as she went down, to look about her. First, she tried to",3.9979753441030024,5.0434785
"make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything;",3.915161139008398,4.904762
then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were,3.608047561296201,4.647059
filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and,4.103097418501983,4.9130435
pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as,4.065380699745992,5.1666665
"disappointment, it was empty; she did not like to drop the jar, so",3.9381860755600533,4.7
managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.,3.8929564887494026,4.7
"Down, down, down! Would the fall never come to an end? There was nothing",4.080643956257665,5.08
"suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry",4.1124495935983525,4.8636365
"leaves, and the fall was over.",3.694739663055176,4.3125
"Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up in a moment. She looked up,",4.123161606134652,4.9166665
but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage and,3.9551268124116175,4.857143
"the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a",4.007453006610617,4.8636365
moment to be lost. Away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to,3.8852906355248327,5.0
the Rabbit was no longer to be seen.,3.662128475400814,4.25
"She found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of",3.971283744249083,4.8636365
"lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all 'round the hall, but",4.0967411458758916,4.9130435
they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side,3.7490386597354206,4.6842103
"and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,",4.008633417318188,4.7619047
wondering how she was ever to get out again.,3.74615711897243,4.3125
"Suddenly she came upon a little table, all made of solid glass. There",4.049986775367911,5.125
"was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice's first idea was that",4.017236760046236,4.9565215
"this might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the",3.8293404906297206,4.8
"locks were too large, or the key was too small, but, at any rate, it",3.8192471665686627,4.8
"would not open any of them. However, on the second time 'round, she came",4.053126683947418,5.125
"upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a",3.8762208648808003,4.5789475
little door about fifteen inches high. She tried the little golden key,3.8791135924962314,4.8095236
"in the lock, and to her great delight, it fitted!",3.7514399472550495,4.4117646
[Illustration],3.521640636343319,3.75
"Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not",3.863975582773205,4.8
much larger than a rat-hole; she knelt down and looked along the passage,3.9181313018665027,4.8
into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of,3.8644574535768705,4.7
that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and,3.9276668178241843,4.5263157
"those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the",3.808105748458937,4.736842
"Alice went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on",4.049165728300576,4.869565
"it, or at any rate, a book of rules for shutting people up like",3.884354172742954,4.5789475
"bottle was a paper label, with the words ""DRINK ME"" beautifully printed",4.345986326922215,5.185185
on it in large letters.,3.414441303694973,3.6666667
"to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had a sort of mixed flavor of",3.8938069973593765,4.8095236
"cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffy and hot buttered",4.063964131314906,4.857143
"toast), she very soon finished it off.",3.812945276259881,4.4117646
       *       *       *       *       *,0.5435644431995964,1.0
"What a curious feeling!"" said Alice. ""I must be shutting up like a,4.226411862604319,5.076923
telescope!",3.027169118440619,3.3333333
"And so it was indeed! She was now only ten inches high, and her face",3.88561941042127,4.8095236
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going,3.746797204998785,4.6666665
through the little door into that lovely garden.,3.7168896489418493,4.4375
"After awhile, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going",3.9527871761072384,4.7
"into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! When she got to the",3.9719643058852565,5.0
"door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she",3.83450820376475,4.736842
"went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach",4.015633458812483,4.8095236
it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her,3.8526530554876004,4.736842
"best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,",3.8782767899668675,4.952381
"and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing",3.8448024002797982,4.736842
sat down and cried.,3.5368867237421693,3.8461537
"sharply. ""I advise you to leave off this minute!"" She generally gave",4.220586358976936,4.9166665
"herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it), and",4.126161408235306,4.9130435
sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her,3.76215748715673,4.6842103
eyes.,1.9219280948873623,2.25
Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:,3.902090163922987,4.904762
"She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself, ""Which way? Which,4.1154368702177075,5.0
way?"" holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way she was",3.836111741238825,4.8
growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same,3.9052647753315655,4.631579
size. So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake.,3.9050834448966874,4.75

II--THE POOL OF TEARS,3.5585186130489066,3.9230769
"""Curiouser and curiouser!"" cried Alice (she was so much surprised that",4.041126011953185,4.8636365
Just at this moment her head struck against the roof of the hall; in,3.894824094257322,4.75
"fact, she was now rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took",3.74888114197119,4.5555553
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.,3.8269103257882793,4.5
"Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to",4.025960882413274,4.9565215
look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more,3.8039008626750905,4.8
hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.,3.9704259677608515,4.952381
"She went on shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all",3.862389320852124,4.736842
'round her and reaching half down the hall.,3.838342081737123,4.5555553
"After a time, she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and",3.7293789057291624,4.6842103
she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White,3.798637640249425,4.8
"Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid-gloves in",4.227585120442807,4.9166665
one hand and a large fan in the other. He came trotting along in a,3.62860723456718,4.5882354
kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he,3.8499434827933805,4.75
could go.,2.9477027792200903,3.125
[Illustration],3.521640636343319,3.75
Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the,3.9186775756836014,4.65
"As she said this, she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see",3.700136693111193,4.6666665
that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while,3.9737385879934175,5.0454545
"she was talking. ""How _can_ I have done that?"" she thought. ""I must be,4.177722876947079,5.04
growing small again."" She got up and went to the table to measure",3.9869253126623283,4.7619047
herself by it and found that she was now about two feet high and was,3.8072926225641504,4.5
going on shrinking rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this,3.9921580669325407,4.857143
"was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily, just in time to",3.931212354471287,4.8095236
save herself from shrinking away altogether.,4.033771256064557,4.631579
"""That _was_ a narrow escape!"" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the",4.1078485703940455,4.9130435
"sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. ""And,4.149493104839415,4.9583335
now for the garden!"" And she ran with all speed back to the little door;",4.030010156414902,5.0
"but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key was",3.88846277711442,4.8
"As she said these words, her foot slipped, and in another moment,",3.87091861692336,4.5555553
splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that,3.892689258227376,4.8095236
"she had somehow fallen into the sea. However, she soon made out that she",3.779481811874557,4.9
was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.,3.6749780929544436,4.611111
[Illustration],3.521640636343319,3.75
Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way,3.9162849395080426,4.8
"off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it",3.669468691510278,4.5882354
was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.,3.970881379939832,4.8
"inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but",3.9006204340676103,4.8636365
it said nothing.,3.327819531114783,3.6363637
"again: ""Où est ma chatte?"" which was the first sentence in her French",3.8764481021644754,4.75

"hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's feelings. ""I quite,4.13708532806971,5.0
forgot you didn't like cats.""",4.116264615668024,4.55

"it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.",3.900888331833762,4.857143
"Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face",4.175982942522378,5.0
"was quite pale, and it said, in a low, trembling voice, ""Let us get to,4.03697609687528,5.0
the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it,3.8840447479577396,4.5555553
is I hate cats and dogs.""",3.639079570624174,4.133333
"It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the",3.8952242338805307,4.909091
"birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo,",3.9575582538285836,4.909091
"a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the",4.0138213973680665,5.0

"table in the window, and on it a fan and two or three pairs of tiny",3.696561774748087,4.611111
white kid-gloves; she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was,4.012185561253715,4.714286
"just going to leave the room, when her eyes fell upon a little bottle",3.88380261979133,5.0

"Mary Ann! Mary Ann!"" said the voice. ""Fetch me my gloves this moment!",4.214209401158739,4.869565
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was,3.8858563799373638,4.857143
the Rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the,3.8556580037064534,4.631579

"Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--""Pat! Pat! Where are you?"" And",4.420116369281483,5.2413793
There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear whispers,3.9955937821408045,4.6666665

"sounds of broken glass. ""I wonder what they'll do next!"" thought Alice.",4.353441608795184,5.0
She waited for some time without hearing anything more. At last came a,4.001401454079951,4.818182
rumbling of little cart-wheels and the sound of a good many voices all,4.107525253049655,4.8636365
Alice drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till,3.9206448372353586,4.631579
she heard a little animal scratching and scrambling about in the chimney,3.8898294216719647,4.5555553

"was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the",4.0090024394462285,4.857143
"cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large caldron which seemed to",3.9770420646468665,4.8
be full of soup.,3.202819531114783,3.4
"""There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!"" Alice said to herself,",4.198702073859847,4.875
as well as she could for sneezing. Even the Duchess sneezed,3.92332404331985,4.9545455
"occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling",4.052739610194444,4.8095236
alternately without a moment's pause. The only two creatures in the,3.9675315944260148,4.8
"kitchen that did _not_ sneeze were the cook and a large cat, which was",3.875647919408126,4.631579
grinning from ear to ear.,3.413660689688186,3.9166667
"Just then the cook took the caldron of soup off the fire, and at once",3.782389262794917,4.736842
set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the,3.816666267508281,4.736842
"baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,",4.213101726321476,4.9565215
"plates and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them, even when they",3.989869850117274,5.0416665
"hit her, and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite",3.9722604471261573,4.857143
impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.,3.806572096950487,4.611111
in an agony of terror.,3.3564924137968246,3.75
"Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped",4.178604697619975,4.9166665
said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply.,3.851495213667546,4.5
that Alice looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there,3.930646467219486,4.8
could be _no_ mistake about it--it was neither more nor less than a pig;,4.104521178248395,4.9130435
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it,3.6301850337181745,4.5555553
trot away quietly into the wood.,3.711897470347699,4.25
Alice was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire-Cat sitting on a,3.8527671193751187,4.85
bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw her.,3.9667936045550403,4.8095236
Alice had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of,3.84321835708817,4.6842103
the March Hare; it was so large a house that she did not like to go near,3.7978845519399433,4.85
till she had nibbled some more of the left-hand bit of mushroom.,3.8991035031419017,4.388889
VII--A MAD TEA-PARTY,3.384183719779189,3.75
"There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the",3.6651398217612354,4.611111
March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it; a Dormouse was sitting,3.8657917845167185,4.857143
"between them, fast asleep.",3.5843031793467115,4.3333335
"The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at",3.653365887474082,4.611111
"one corner of it. ""No room! No room!"" they cried out when they saw Alice",3.992106601509339,5.0
"coming. ""There's _plenty_ of room!"" said Alice indignantly, and she sat",4.372099240510815,5.0
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.,3.831789011092168,4.5789475
"The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all he said",3.951873141704664,4.8636365
"was ""Why is a raven like a writing-desk?""",4.012155432453934,4.6
added aloud.,2.751629167387823,3.5
"""Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?"" said the",3.8909346904771476,4.8095236
March Hare.,3.095795255000934,3.2222223
"talking in its sleep, ""that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing,3.8454210922493637,4.85
as 'I sleep when I breathe!'""",3.7124885486146892,4.25
little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently,3.8934424253407665,4.85
[Illustration],3.521640636343319,3.75
"""Have you guessed the riddle yet?"" the Hatter said, turning to Alice",4.069020087117277,4.7272725
again.,2.251629167387823,2.6
"At this, Alice got up and walked off. The Dormouse fell asleep instantly",4.252492884104656,5.1153846
"and neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she",3.6747223436996888,5.0
"looked back once or twice; the last time she saw them, they were",3.862997562960808,4.75
trying to put the Dormouse into the tea-pot.,3.7489515066182055,4.4444447
[Illustration: The Trial of the Knave of Hearts.],4.1878497020561545,4.8636365
"her way through the wood. ""It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in,3.9891530326031615,5.0
all my life!"" Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees",3.8474922555681554,4.904762
"had a door leading right into it. ""That's very curious!"" she thought. ""I,4.145095751731726,4.9130435
think I may as well go in at once."" And in she went.",3.9159399581512604,4.857143
Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little,3.7421690882631475,4.5555553
"glass table. Taking the little golden key, she unlocked the door that",3.9782426484512445,4.857143
led into the garden. Then she set to work nibbling at the mushroom (she,3.9546158195372367,4.7619047
had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high;,3.9227801329710332,5.0
then she walked down the little passage; and _then_--she found herself,3.9753221837251864,4.857143
"at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the",4.001338707051728,4.7
cool fountains.,3.456564762130954,3.75
VIII--THE QUEEN'S CROQUET GROUND,3.9292292966721747,4.2352943
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden; the roses,3.611074645888839,4.647059
"growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily",3.754274878324996,4.7222223
"painting them red. Suddenly their eyes chanced to fall upon Alice, as",4.149493104839414,4.7826085
"little timidly, ""why you are painting those roses?""",4.1059485691885405,4.8095236
"Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began, in a low",4.027145760609234,4.7727275
"moment, Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called",4.223936461697899,4.9583335
"out, ""The Queen! The Queen!"" and the three gardeners instantly threw",3.905436422942323,4.952381
themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,4.02093128740062,4.9545455
"and Alice looked 'round, eager to see the Queen.",3.917481250360578,5.0
"First came ten soldiers carrying clubs, with their hands and feet at the",3.9994964483932205,4.909091
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with,3.8130332038224313,4.7
"diamonds. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them,",3.935328855835221,4.904762
"all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and",4.104906341888089,5.0434785
"Queens, and among them Alice recognized the White Rabbit. Then followed",4.286185642340252,5.0740743
"the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet",4.0792049027409565,4.8636365

QUEEN OF HEARTS.,3.577819531114783,3.8461537
"When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked",3.919723474718126,4.65
"at her, and the Queen said severely, ""Who is this?"" She said it to the",3.8603399829238474,4.857143
"Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.",4.1542161028736295,4.9565215
"""Can you play croquet?"" shouted the Queen. The question was evidently",4.224648559395821,5.08
meant for Alice.,3.75,3.9285715
"""Yes!"" said Alice loudly.",3.8634651896016465,4.25
"""It's--it's a very fine day!"" said a timid voice to Alice. She was",4.216436499447937,5.1923075
"walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.",4.239718648160902,5.0
"Hush! Hush!"" said the Rabbit. ""She's under sentence of execution.",4.202001832404323,4.7826085
"""What for?"" said Alice.",4.0559581516151235,4.2777777
"""She boxed the Queen's ears--"" the Rabbit began.",4.0450427723692055,5.090909
"""Get to your places!"" shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and",4.067068460812728,4.9130435
"people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each",3.9562382463956127,4.5789475
"other. However, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game",3.90186510460269,4.904762
began.,2.5849625007211565,2.6666667
Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her,3.90283295978646,4.5263157
life; it was all ridges and furrows. The croquet balls were live,4.0690697618696765,4.9565215
"hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingos and the soldiers had to double",3.895251081749231,4.631579
"themselves up and stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",3.8610312757562357,4.904762
"The players all played at once, without waiting for turns, quarrelling",4.149604054299753,4.818182
"all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time,",3.9293595673614696,4.85
"the Queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting,",3.905900961293777,4.7
"""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her head!"" about once in a minute.",4.0235724398773725,4.7619047
"She was looking about for some way of escape, when she noticed a curious",4.093455463218814,5.0416665
now I shall have somebody to talk to.,3.912946130776852,4.4736843
"""How are you getting on?"" said the Cat.",4.005501014736771,4.6

oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular.""",4.196236974571989,4.9583335
"""How do you like the Queen?"" said the Cat in a low voice.",4.0495787774674685,5.0
[Illustration],3.521640636343319,3.75
Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going,3.8457357833336685,4.5789475
on. So she went off in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged,3.6962462158687353,4.7222223
"in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent",3.8827829637800724,4.75
opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other; the only,3.8011912896935534,4.6842103
difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of,3.9400765010856817,4.631579
"the garden, where Alice could see it trying, in a helpless sort of way,",4.031303755284507,4.8095236
to fly up into a tree. She caught the flamingo and tucked it away under,4.023077353581902,4.818182
"her arm, that it might not escape again.",3.6935423971431804,4.1875
Just then Alice ran across the Duchess (who was now out of prison). She,4.061568327191226,5.0
tucked her arm affectionately into Alice's and they walked off together.,4.1380646763612186,4.826087
Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper. She was a,4.07076779962396,5.0833335
"little startled, however, when she heard the voice of the Duchess close",3.820817925826399,4.6842103
up the conversation a little.,3.797467632984005,4.25
"sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder, as she added ""and the moral of,4.007672437962544,4.8095236

themselves.'""",3.1808329872054406,3.5
"To Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's arm that was linked into hers",4.116075685398007,5.0
began to tremble. Alice looked up and there stood the Queen in front of,3.9756547290206656,5.0
"them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm!",4.096158111363147,4.5

"All the time they were playing, the Queen never left off quarreling with",3.9489055153557144,4.9545455
"the other players and shouting, ""Off with his head!"" or ""Off with her,4.061301544224816,4.8636365

Alice ran along with the others.,3.816428031846024,4.25
IX--WHO STOLE THE TARTS?,3.6368421881310122,4.071429
The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they,3.76745577125489,4.8
"arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little",4.041577045689309,4.7619047

"standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard",3.963404623903606,4.65
"him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand",3.889136860563213,4.9545455
and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court,3.948159798384951,4.857143
"The judge, by the way, was the King and he wore his crown over his great",3.994335293783485,4.9545455
"Just then the White Rabbit cried out ""Silence in the court!""",3.927806122538451,4.857143

"On this, the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, then",3.7961333396140433,4.85
unrolled the parchment-scroll and read as follows:,3.9781719394718382,4.631579
"blasts on the trumpet and called out, ""First witness!""",4.09700254965735,4.8636365

and a piece of bread and butter in the other.,3.6628805958008273,4.3125
"The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the",3.844146060160857,4.85
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all; he kept shifting from,4.006989317535721,4.9545455
"one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and, in his",3.793877906406283,4.7894735

and butter.,3.277613436819116,3.4
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation--she was,4.028828470024671,4.8095236
beginning to grow larger again.,3.474380085195674,4.076923

"""Call the next witness!"" said the King.",3.9065704878156495,4.388889
The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the pepper-box in,4.116114884864559,5.0
